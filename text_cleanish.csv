Joy,"Do you ever look at someone and wonder, what is going on inside their head? Well, I know. Well, I know Riley's head."
Joy,And there she was.
Mom,Hello. Riley.
Dad,"Oh, look at you. Aren't you a little bundle of joy."
Joy,Whoa.
Joy,It was amazing. Just Riley and me forever.
Joy,Or for thirty-three seconds.
Sadness,I'm Sadness.
Joy,"Oh, hello. I'm Joy, so. Can I just, if you could.I just want to fix that."
Joy,Thanks.
Joy,And that was just the beginning. Headquarters only got more crowded from there.
Fear,"Very nice. Okay, looks like you got this. Very good. Whoa, sharp turn.! no, look out, no!"
Joy,That's Fear. He's really good at keeping Riley safe.
Fear,Easy. Easy. Ahh.Hop it!
Fear,"Oh, we're good. We're good."
Both,Whoo. Good job.
Fear,Thank you. Thank you very much.
Joy,And we're back!
Dad,"Here we go, alright. Open."
Joy,"Hm, this looks new."
Fear,Think it's safe?
Sadness,What is it?
Disgust,"Okay, caution. There is a dangerous smell, people. Hold on. What is that?"
Joy,"This is Disgust. She basically keeps Riley from being poison, physically and socially."
Disgust,That is not brightly colored. Or shaped like a dinosaur. Hold on guys. It's broccoli!
Riley,Yucky!
Disgust,Well. I just saved our lives.
Disgust,"Yeah, you're welcome."
Dad,"Riley, if you don't eat your dinner, you're not going to get any dessert."
Anger,Wait. Did he just say we couldn't have dessert?
Joy,That's Anger. He cares very deeply about things being fair.
Anger,"So, that's how you want to play it, old man! No dessert? Oh, sure! We'll eat our dinner! Right after you eat this."
Dad,"""Riley, Riley. Here comes an airplane."""
Anger,"Oh airplane.We got an airplane, everybody."
All,Ooh.
Joy,"And you've met Sadness. She.well, she."
Joy,"I'm not actually sure what she does. And I've checked, there's no place for her to go. So, she's good. We're good. It's all great."
Joy,"Anyway.These are Riley's memories. And they are mostly happy if you'll notice, not to brag."
Joy,But the really important ones are over here.
Joy,I don't want to get too technical but these are called core memories. Each one came from a super important time in Riley's life. Like when she first scored a goal. It was so amazing.
Joy,And each core memory powers a different aspect of Riley's personality.
Joy,"Like, Hockey Island. Goofball Island is my personal favorite."
Joy,Yup. Goofball is the best.Friendship Island is pretty good too.
Joy,"Ooh, I love Honesty Island. And that's the truth."
Joy,"And of course, Family Island is amazing."
Joy,"The point is, the islands are personality are what make Riley, Riley."
Dad,Good night.
Riley,Goodnight Dad.
Joy,And we're out. That's what I'm talking about. Wooh! Another perfect day. Nice job everybody. Let's get those memories down to long term.
Fear,Alright. We did not die today. I call that an unqualified success.
Joy,"And, that's it. We love our girl. She's got great friends and a great house. Things couldn't be better. After all, Riley is eleven now. What could happen?"
Joy,What?
Joy,Okay. Not what I had in mind.
Joy,"Hey, look! The Golden Gate Bridge, isn't that great? It's not made up of solid gold like we thought, which is kind of a disappointment. But still."
Fear,"I sure am glad you told me earthquakes are a myth, Joy. Otherwise I'd be terrified right now."
Joy,Uh.yeah.
Anger,These are my kind of people.
Dad,"Alright, just a few more blocks. We're almost to our new house."
Anger,"Step on it, Daddy."
Disgust,Why can't we just live in the smelly car? We're already been in it forever.
Joy,Which. actually was really lucky. Because that gave us plenty of time to think about what our new house is going to look like. What? Let's review the top five daydreams.
Fear,"Ooh, that looks safe."
Sadness,That looks nice.
Joy,"Ooh, this will be great for Riley. Oh! No, no, no, this one."
Disgust,"Joy, for the last time, she cannot live in a cookie."
Anger,That's the one. It comes with a dragon.
Joy,Are we getting close? I can feel it. Here it is. Here's our new house. And.
Joy,"Maybe, it's nice on the inside."
Anger,We're supposed to live here?
Sadness,Do we have to?
Disgust,"I'm telling you, it smells that something died in here."
Fear,Can you die from moving?
Joy,"Guys, you're overreacting. Nobody is die."
Disgust,A DEAD MOUSE!
Anger,Great.
Disgust,I'm gonna be sick.
Fear,It's a house of the dead! What are we gonna do? We're gonna get rabies!
Anger,Get off of me!
Joy,"All through the drive, Dad talked about how cool our new room is. Let's go check it out."
Fear,"It's gonna be great. Yes, yes, yes, yes!"
Fear,"No, no, no, no."
Disgust,I'm starting to envy the dead mouse.
Anger,Get out the rubber ball. We're in solitary confinement.
Sadness,Riley can't live here.
Anger,She's right.
Disgust,It's the worst.
Fear,Really bad.
Disgust,It's absolutely the worst.
Anger,This house stinks.
Disgust,It's the worst place I've been in my entire life.
Fear,"Oh, yeah."
Joy,"Hey, it's nothing our butterfly curtains couldn't fix. I read somewhere that an empty room is an opportunity."
Anger,Where did you read that?
Joy,"It doesn't matter, I read it and it's great. We'll put the bed there, and the desk over there."
Fear,The hockey lamp goes there.
Anger,"Uh, put the chair there."
Joy,Or the trophy collections.
Fear,There. Stars! I like that.
Joy,"Now, we're talking. Let's go get our stuff from the moving van."
Dad,"Well, guess what? The moving van won't be here until Thursday."
Mom,You're kidding.
Fear,Our van is lost? It's the worst day ever!
Mom,You said it would be here yesterday.
Dad,And I know that's what I said. That's what they told me.
Fear,Mom and Dad are stressed out!
Anger,They're stressed out?
Someone,Arguing!
Fear,What are we going to do?
Joy,I've got a great idea!
Mom,Did you even read the contract?
Riley,Andersen makes her move. She's closing in.
Dad,"Hey. Oh no, you're not."
Dad,Oh no.You're not.
Riley,She's lining up for the shot she shoots and she scores yeah.
Riley,C'mon Grandma.
Mom,Ha Grandma.
Joy,Uh oh she's putting her hair up.We're in for it.
Dad,"Sorry, hold on."
Dad,Hello?
Joy,Wait. What?
Dad,"You're kidding. Alright. Stall for me, I'll be right there."
Dad,"The investors are supposed to show up on Thursday, not today. I gotta go."
Mom,"It's okay, we get it."
Dad,"You're the best. Thanks, hon."
Dad,"See you, sweetie."
Fear,Dad just left us.
Sadness,"Oh, he doesn't love us anymore. That's sad. I should drive, right?"
Sadness,"Joy, what are you doing?"
Joy,"Uh, just give me one second. Um, you know what I've realized? Riley hasn't had lunch. Remember?"
Riley,"Hey, I saw a pizza place down the street. Maybe we could try that."
Mom,Pizza sounds delicious.
Fear,Pizza!
Anger,Pizza.
Disgust,"Yes, pizza."
Anger,Great idea. Let's get it.
Fear,What the heck is that?
Joy,Who puts broccoli on pizza!
Disgust,"That's it, I'm done."
Anger,"Congratulations San Francisco, you've ruined pizza! First the Hawaiians, and now you!"
Mom,"What kind of a pizza place only serves one kind of pizza? Must be a San Francisco thing. Still, it's not as bad as the soup at that diner in Nebraska."
Riley,"Oh, yeah. The spoon stood up in the soup by itself. That was disgusting."
Joy,We're good. Family's running.
Mom,"The drive out was pretty fun, huh? What was your favorite part?"
Anger,Spitting out of the car window!
Disgust,Definitely not when Dad was singing.
Fear,Wearing a seat belt.
Joy,"Oh, what about the time with the dinosaur?"
Fear,"Oh, that's the one."
Riley,"I like that time with the dinosaur, that was pretty funny."
Joy,"Wait, what? What happened?"
Fear,She did something to the memory.
Joy,What did you do?
Sadness,I.I just touched it.
Joy,That shouldn't make it change.
Fear,"Oh, change it back, Joy!"
Joy,I'm trying.
Anger,You can't change it back?
Joy,No. I guess I can't.
Disgust,"Good going, Sadness. Now when Riley thinks of that moment with Dad, she's gonna feel sad. Bravo."
Sadness,"I'm sorry, Joy. I don't really know. I thought maybe if you, if you, I."
Disgust,"Joy, we got a stairway coming up."
Joy,Just don't touch any other memories until we figured out what's going on.
Sadness,Okay.
Joy,Alright. Get ready. This is the monster railing and we are riding it all the way down.
Joy,"Wait, what? What happened?"
Fear,A core memory!
Joy,"Oh, no."
Joy,"Sadness, what are you doing?"
Sadness,"It looked like one was crooked, so I opened it and then it fell out."
Sadness,"It's just that, I wanted to maybe hold one."
Fear,Joy!
Joy,"Woh, woh, woh!"
Joy,"Sadness, you nearly touch a core memory. And when you touch them, we can't change them back!"
Sadness,"Oh, I know. I'm sorry. Something's wrong with me. I. it's like I'm having a break down."
Joy,You're not having a break down. It's stress.
Sadness,I keep making mistakes like that. I'm awful.
Joy,"No, you're not."
Sadness,And annoying.
Joy,"They, well, uh, you know what? You can't focus on what's going wrong. There's always a way to turn things around, to find the fun."
Sadness,"Yeah, find the fun. I don't know how to do that."
Joy,"Okay. Well, try to think of something funny."
Sadness,"Um. Oh, remember the funny movie where the dog dies?"
Joy,"Oh, yeah. That's not."
Joy,"What about that time, with Meg? When Riley laughed so hard, milk came out of her nose."
Joy,Come on.
Sadness,"Yeah, that hurt. It felt like fire. It was awf."
Joy,"Okay, okay. Don't think of that. Let's try something else. Um, what're your favorite things to do?"
Sadness,"My favorite? Um, well, I like it when we're outside."
Joy,"That's good! Like, there's the beach and sunshine. Oh, like the time we buried Dad in the sand up to his neck."
Sadness,I was thinking more like rain.
Joy,"Rain. Rain is my favorite too! We can stomp around the puddles, you know? There's cool umbrellas, lightning storms."
Sadness,"More like when the rain runs down our back, and makes our shoe soggy. And we get all cold, shivery and everything just starts feeling droopy."
Joy,"Oh. Hey, hey, hey. Easy. Why are you crying? It's.it's like really the opposite of what we're going for here."
Sadness,Crying helps me slow down and obsessive over the weight of life's problems.
Joy,"You know what? Let's, uh, think about something else. How about we read some mind manuals? Huh? Sounds fun."
Sadness,I've read most of them.
Joy,"Well, have you read this one? This seem interesting."
Joy,Long Term Memory Retrieval Volume 47.
Sadness,No.
Joy,"Ooh, a real page turner."
Sadness,Long term memory data selection via channels sub-grouping.
Joy,"See! Fun already. Oh, you lucky dog. You're reading these cool things, I gotta go work. Life is so unfair."
Riley,"Mom, Dad. Come kiss me good night."
Mom,Be right there!
Fear,Did you hear Dad? He sounded really upset.
Fear,What was that? Was it a bear? It's a bear!
Disgust,There are no bears in San Francisco.
Anger,"I saw a really hairy guy, he looked like a bear."
Fear,"Ooh, I'm so jumpy. My nerves are shot!"
Disgust,Ew! I don't wanna hear about your nerves.
Anger,I'll tell you what it is. This move has been a bust.
Fear,That's what I've been telling you guys. There are at least thirty-seven things for Riley to be scared of right now.
Disgust,The smell alone is enough to make her gag.
Anger,I can't believe Mom and Dad moved us here!
Joy,"Look, I get it. You guys have concerns. But we've been through worse. Tell you what, let's make a list of all the things Riley should be happy about."
Anger,Fine. Let's see. This house stinks. Our room stinks.
Disgust,Pizza is weird here.
Sadness,Our friends are back home.
Fear,And all our stuff is in the missing van.
Joy,"Oh, come on. It could be worse."
Disgust,"Yeah, Joy. We could be lying on a dirty floor, in a bag."
Joy,"Okay, I admit it. We had a rough start. But think of all the good things that."
Anger,"No, Joy. There's absolutely no reason for Riley to be happy right now. Let us handle this."
Fear,I say we skip school tomorrow and lock ourselves in the bedroom.
Disgust,We have no clean clothes. I mean no one should see us
Sadness,"Yeah, we could cry until we can't breathe."
Anger,We should lock the door and scream that curse word we know. It's a good one!
Joy,"Now, hold on. Look, we all have our off days. You know."
Mom,"Hi, honey."
Anger,The Mom bad news train is pulling in. Toot-toot!
Mom,Still no moving van. Now they're saying it won't be here till Tuesday. Can you believe it?
Anger,Toot-toot-toot!
Riley,Where's Dad?
Mom,On the phone. This new adventure is keeping him pretty busy.
Anger,I rest my case.
Mom,"Your Dad's a little stress, you know, about getting his new company up and running."
Anger,"Now, for a few well place withering scowls."
Mom,"I guess all I really want to say is, thank you."
Anger,Huh?
Mom,"You know, through all these confusion you've stayed. Well, you've stayed our happy girl. Your Dad is under a lot of pressure. But, if you and I can keep smiling, it would be a big help. We can do that for him. Right?"
Joy,Whoa.
Joy,Well.
Riley,"Yeah, sure. What did we do to deserve you?"
Mom,Sweet dreams.
Riley,Good night.
Anger,"Well, you can't argue with Mom. Happy it is."
Disgust,"Can't argue with Mom, that's true."
Fear,Team Happy. Sounds great.
Disgust,"Totally behind you, Joy."
Joy,"Looks like we're going into REM. I've got dream duty so I'll take care of sending these to long term. Great day today, guys. All sleep well, team Happy.What's on dream production."
Joy,"Who is in charge of programming down there? I know I'm not supposed to do this, but."
Joy,We are not going to end the day like this.
Joy,Don't you worry. I'm going to make sure that tomorrow is another great day. I promise.
Joy,Hello. Did I wake you?
Anger,Do you have to play that?
Joy,"Well, I have to practice. And I don't think of it as playing so much as hugging."
Joy,"Okay, first day of school. Very, very exciting. I was up late last night figuring out a new plan. Here it is! Fear, I need a list of all the possible negative outcomes on the first day at a new school."
Fear,Way ahead of you there. Does anyone know how to spell meteor?
Joy,"Disgust, make sure Riley stands out today. But also blends in."
Disgust,"When I'm through, I think you're look so good, the other things will look at their own outfits and barf."
Joy,"Joy. Yes, Joy. You'll be in charge of the console, keeping Riley happy all day long. And may I add, I love your dress, it's adorable. Oh, this old thing. Thank you so much. I love the way it twirls."
Joy,"Train of Thought, right on schedule. Anger, unload the daydreams. I ordered extra, in case things get slow in class."
Anger,"Might come in handy, if this new school is full of boring, useless classes. Which it probably will be."
Joy,"Oh, Sadness. I have a super important job just for you."
Sadness,Really?
Joy,Um-hmm. Follow me.
Sadness,What are you doing?
Joy,"And there, perfect. This is the circle of sadness. Your job is to make sure that all the sadness stays inside of it."
Sadness,"So, you want me just to stand here?"
Joy,"Hey, it's not my place to tell you how to do your job. Just make sure that all the sadness stays in the circle. See! You're a pro at this. Isn't this fun?"
Sadness,No.
Joy,At a girl.
Joy,"Alright everyone, fresh start. We are going to have a good day which will turn into a good week, which will turn into a good year, which turns into a good life!"
Mom,"So, big day. New school. New friends. Huh?"
Riley,"I know. I'm kind of nervous, but I'm mostly excited. How do I look? Do you like my shirt?"
Mom,Very cute. You gonna be okay? You want us to walk with you?
Disgust,"Mom and Dad, with us in public. No, thank you."
Joy,"Yep, I'm on it."
Riley,"Nope, I'm fine. Bye Mom. Bye Dad."
Dad,"Have a good day in school, monster."
Mom,"Have a great day, sweetheart."
Disgust,"Okay, we've got a group of cool girls at two o'clock."
Joy,How do you know?
Disgust,"Double ears pierce, infinity scarf."
Joy,Woh. Is she wearing eye shadow?
Disgust,Yeah. We want to be friends with them.
Joy,Let's go talk to them.
Disgust,Are you kidding? We're not talking to them! We want them to like us.
Joy,"Oh. Yeah. Wait, what?"
Fear,"Almost finished with the potential disasters. Worst scenario is either quicksands, spontaneous combustion or getting called on by the teacher. So as long as none of those happens."
Teacher,"Okay, everybody. We have a new student in class today."
Fear,Are you kidding me! Out of the date! This is not happening!
Teacher,"Riley, would you like to tell us something about yourself?"
Fear,No! Pretend we can't speak English.
Joy,"Don't worry, I got this."
Riley,My name is Riley Andersen. I'm from Minnesota and now I live here.
Teacher,And how about Minnesota? Can you tell us something about it? Well you certainly get a lot more snow than we do.
Joy,She's hilarious.
Riley,"Yeah, it gets pretty cold. The lake freezes over, and that's when we play hockey. I'm on a great team; we're called the Prairie dogs. My friend, Meg plays forward and my Dad's the coach. Pretty much everyone in my family skates; it's kind of a family tradition. We go out on the lake almost every weekend."
Riley,"Or, we did till I moved away."
Disgust,Hey. What gives?
Fear,What?
Joy,"Hey, Sadness! You touched a memory? We talked about this."
Sadness,"Oh, yeah, I know. I'm sorry."
Joy,Get back in your circle.
Joy,What's going on?
Fear,"Get it out of there, Joy."
Joy,Eject.
Riley,We used to play tag and stuff.
Disgust,Who knows but it is at three o'clock.
Fear,Did you see that look? They're touching us!
Riley,"But, everything is different now. Since we moved."
Fear,"Oh, no. We're crying and sloth!"
Joy,"What? Sadness, what are you doing!"
Sadness,"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm, oh."
Fear,It's a core memory.
Disgust,"But, it's blue."
Joy,No! Wait! Stop it! No!
Sadness,"Joy, no. That's a core memory!"
Joy,Hey! Stop it! Let go!
Sadness,Don't! Wait!
Fear,The core memories!
Teacher,"Thank you, Riley. I know it can be tough moving to a new place, but we are happy to have you here. Alright, everyone. Get out you history books and turn to chapter 7."
Anger,Can I say that curse word now?
Joy,Where are we? Long term memory? Wait.
Joy,Goofball Island?
Sadness,"Riley's islands of personality, they're all down! Oh, this is bad."
Joy,"We.we can fix this. We just have to get back to Headquarters, plug the core memories in and Riley will be back to normal."
Sadness,Oh. Riley has no core memories. No personality islands and no. Oh.
Joy,What? What is it?
Sadness,"You. You're not in Headquarters. Without you, Riley can't be happy. We gotta get you back up there."
Joy,"I'm coming, Riley."
Mom,"So, as it turns out the green trash can is not recycling, it's for greens, like compose and egg shells. And the blue one is recycling, and the black one is trash."
Disgust,Riley is acting so weird. Why is she acting so weird?
Anger,What did you expect? All the islands are down.
Disgust,Joy would know what to do.
Fear,"That's it. Until she gets back, we just do what Joy would do."
Disgust,"Great idea. Anger, Fear, Disgust. How are we supposed to be happy?!"
Mom,"Hey, Riley. I've got good news. I found a junior hockey league, right here, in San Francisco. And get this, tryouts are tomorrow after school. What luck, right?"
Fear,Hockey?
Disgust,Uh-oh. What do we do?
Fear,"Guys, th.this. Here, you pretend to be Joy."
Mom,Wouldn't it be great to be back out on the ice?
Riley,"Oh, yeah. That sounds fantastic."
Fear,What was that? That wasn't anything like Joy!
Disgust,Ah.because I'm not Joy.
Fear,"Yeah, no kidding."
Mom's Sadness,Did you guys pick up on that?
Mom's Disgust,Somethings wrong.
Mom's Anger,Should we ask her?
Mom's Sadness,"Let's probe, but keep it subtle so she doesn't notice."
Mom,"So, how was the first day of school?"
Anger,She's probing us.
Disgust,I'm done. You pretend to be Joy.
Fear,"What? Okay. Uh, hmm."
Riley,"It was fine, I guess. I don't know."
Disgust,"Oh, very smooth. That was just like Joy."
Mom's Anger,Something is definitely is going on.
Mom's Disgust,She's never acted like this before. What should we do?
Mom's Sadness,"We're gonna find out what's happening, but we'll need support."
Mom's Sadness,Signal the husband.
Mom,Ahem.
Mom,Ahem!
Dad's Anger,Uh-oh. She's looking at us. What did she say?
Dad's Fear,"What? Oh, sorry, sir. No one was listening."
Dad's Anger,"Is it garbage night? Uh, we let the toilet seat up. What? What is it, woman? What?!"
Mom's Disgust,He's making that stupid face again.
Mom's Anger,I could strangle him right now!
Mom's Sadness,Signal him again.
Dad,"Ah, so, Riley, how was school?"
Mom's Joy,Seriously?
Mom's Sadness,You got to be kidding me.
Mom's Anger,"For this, we gave up that Brazilian helicopter pilot?"
Anger,Move! I'll be Joy.
Riley,School was great. Alright?
Mom,"Riley, is everything okay?"
Dad's Fear,"Sir, she just rolled her eyes at us."
Dad's Anger,"What is her deal? Alright, make a show of force. I don't want to have to put the foot down."
Dad's Fear,No. Not the foot.
Dad,"Riley, I do not like this new attitude."
Anger,"Oh, I'll show you attitude, old man."
Fear,"No. No, no, no. Stay happy!"
Riley,What is your problem? Just leave me alone!
Dad's Fear,"Sir, reporting high level of sass."
Dad's Anger,Take it to DEFCON 2.
Dad's Fear,"You heard that, gentlemen. DEFCON 2."
Dad,"Listen, young lady. I don't know where this disrespectful attitude came from."
Anger,"You want a piece of this, pops. Come and get it!"
Riley,Yeah. Well.well.
Dad's Anger,Here it comes. Prepare the foot!
Dad's Fear,"Keys, to safety position."
Dad's Fear,"Ready to launch on your command, sir."
Riley,"Just, shut up!"
Dad's Anger,Fire!
Dad,That's it! Go to your room. Now!
Dad's Fear,The foot is down! The foot is down!
Dad's Anger,"Good job, gentlemen. That could've been a disaster."
Mom's Sadness,"Well, that was a disaster."
Helicopter Pilot,"Come. Fly with me, gatinha."
Sadness,"We're gonna walk out there, on that?"
Joy,It's the quickest way back.
Sadness,"But it's over the Memory Dump. If we fall, we'll be forgotten forever."
Joy,We have to do this for Riley. Just follow my footsteps.
Joy,Not that high. It's totally fin.
Dad,"Hey. So, uh, things got a little out of hand downstairs. Do you want to talk about it? *Come on. Where's my happy girl? Monster."
Anger,Woh. He's trying to start up Goofball.
Dad,I get it. You need some alone time. We'll talk later.
Disgust,We have a major problem.
Fear,"Oh, Joy. Where are you?"
Sadness,"We lost Goofball Island. That means she can lose Friendship and Hockey and Honesty and Family. You can fix this. Right, Joy?"
Joy,"I. Uh, I don't know."
Sadness,Oh.
Joy,"But we have to try. Okay, come on. Riley's gone to sleep. Which is a good thing, when you think about it. Because nothing else bad could happen when she's asleep. We'll be back to Headquarters fore she wakes up. We'll just go across Friendship Island."
Sadness,"Oh, we'll never make it."
Joy,"No, no. No, no, no, no. Don't obsess over the weight of life's problems! Remember the funny movie where the dog dies!"
Joy,"Oh, Sadness. We don't have time for this. We'll.we'll just have to go around. Take the scenic route."
Sadness,"Wait. Joy, you can get lost in there."
Joy,Think positive.
Sadness,"Okay, I'm positive you will get lost in there. That's long term memory. An endless warren of corridors and shelves. I read about it in the manuals."
Joy,The manuals? The manuals! You read the manuals!
Sadness,Yeah.
Joy,So you know the way back to Headquarters.
Sadness,I.I guess.
Joy,"You are my map. Let's go. Lead on, my map. Show me where we're going."
Sadness,"Okay, only. I'm too sad to walk. Just give me a few hours to."
Joy,"Which way, left?"
Sadness,Right.
Sadness,"No, I mean go left. I said left was right like correct."
Joy,Okay.
Sadness,This actually feels kind of nice.
Joy,"Okay, here we go. We'll be back to Headquarters before morning. We can do it. This will be easy! This is working."
Joy,This is not working. Are we getting close?
Sadness,"Yeah, just another right. And a left. And then another left and a right."
Joy,"Are you sure you know where we're going? Cause we seem to be walking away from Headquarters. Riley's awake. Uh-uh! Don't. Don't touch, remember? If you touch them, they stay sad."
Sadness,"Oh, sorry. I.I won't. Starting now."
Joy,I can't take much more of this.
Mind Worker #1,Phone numbers.
Mind Worker #2,Oh.
Mind Worker #1,"We don't need all these, they're in her phone."
Mind Worker #2,"Just forget all of that, please."
Joy,Excuse me. Hi!
Mind Worker #2,Forget it!
Joy,I need to find Friendship Island.
Mind Worker #1,Look at this. Four years of piano lessons.
Mind Worker #2,"Yeah, it looks pretty faded."
Mind Worker #1,"You know what? Save Chopsticks and Heart and Soul, get rid of the rest. US presidents. What do you think?"
Mind Worker #2,"Just keep Washington, Lincoln and the fat one."
Mind Worker #1,Forget em!
Joy,Hey! You can't throw those away! Those are perfectly good memories.
Mind Worker #2,The names of every Cutiepie Princess doll?
Joy,"Yes. That is critical information. Glitter storm, Honey pants."
Mind Worker #1,Forget em!
Joy,Hey! Bring those back!
Mind Worker #1,They're in the Dump. Nothing comes back from the Dump.
Mind Worker #2,"Yeah. Look, lady. This is our job, okay."
Mind Worker #1,"When Riley doesn't care about a memory, it fades."
Joy,Fades?
Mind Worker #1,Happens to the best of them.
Mind Worker #2,Except for this bad boy. This one will never fade.
Joy,The song from the gum commercial?
Mind Worker #2,"You know, sometimes we send that one up to Headquarters for no reason."
Mind Worker #1,It just plays in Riley's head over and over again like a million times.
Mind Worker #1,Let's watch it again.
Joy,"Yeah, I know. We all know the song. Okay, real catchy."
Mind Worker #2,"Hey. What do you think, should we do it?"
Mind Worker #1,Yeah.
Mind Worker #2,Okay. Here we go!
Anger,What the.? This again!
Meg,Do you like it there? Did you feel any earthquakes? Is the bridge cool?
Riley,"Yeah, it's good. What happened with the playoffs."
Meg,"We won the first game. Coach says we might actually go to the finals this year. Oh, and we got this new girl on the team. She's so cool."
Disgust,"Uh, she did not just say that."
Fear,A new girl?! Meg has a new friend already?
Disgust,"Hey-hey. Stay happy. We do not want to lose anymore islands here, guys."
Meg,We can pass the puck to each other without even looking. It's like mind reading.
Anger,"You like to read minds, Meg. I got something for you to read right here!"
Disgust,Anger. What?
Fear,"Wait, wait, wait! Let's just be calm for one second.!"
Riley,I gotta go.
Meg,What?
Riley,I gotta go!
Joy,"Oh, no. Friendship Island! What? Not Friendship."
Sadness,"Oh, Riley loved that one. And now it's gone. Goodbye, Friendship. Hello, Loneliness."
Joy,We'll just have to go the long way.
Sadness,"Yeah. The long, long, long, long way. I'm ready."
Joy,There's gotta be a better way. Excuse me.
Bing Bong,Oh. Ah! I was.I was looking for diversion!
Joy,What?
Bing Bong,"Ha-ha! So long, sucker! Ow. I hurt all over."
Joy,"Wait, I know you."
Bing Bong,"No, you don't. I get that a lot. I look like a lot of people."
Joy,"No, no, no. I do. Bing Bong! Riley's imaginary friend."
Bing Bong,You really do know me?
Joy,"Well, of course! Riley loved playing with you. You two were best friends! Oh, oh. You might know. We're trying to get back to Headquarters."
Bing Bong,Headquarters? You guys are from Headquarters?
Joy,"Well, yeah. I'm Joy. This is Sadness."
Bing Bong,"You're Joy, the Joy?"
Joy,Mm-hmm.
Bing Bong,Well what the heck are you doing out here?
Joy,"That's a good question. You want to answer that, Sadness?"
Bing Bong,"Wow. Without you, Riley won't ever be happy. We can't have that. We gotta get you back. I'll tell you what, follow me."
Joy,"Thank you. It is so great to see you again. I gotta tell you, I'm such a huge fan of your work. Do you remember when you and Riley were in a band? I went to all of your concerts."
Bing Bong,Yeah. I blow a mean nose.
Joy,Watching you play tag was such a treat.
Bing Bong,Two time room champ.
Joy,"Oh, and remember your rockets."
Bing Bong,"Of course, it runs on song power."
Joy,That's right. Your theme song. Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing Bong,Bing Bong! Bing Bong!
Joy,"His rocket makes you yell ""Hooray!"""
Joy and Bing Bong,Bing Bong! Bing Bong!
Sadness,What exactly are you supposed to be?
Bing Bong,"You know, it's unclear. I'm mostly cotton candy. But shape wise, I'm part cat, part elephant, part dolphin."
Joy,Dolphin?
Bing Bong,"You gotta remember, when Riley was three, animals were all the rage. The cow goes meow, the horse goes oink. It's all people talked about back then."
Joy,"Yeah, yeah. I guess that's true. What are you doing out here?"
Bing Bong,"Well, there's not much call for imaginary friends lately. So, I. Um, you know?"
Joy,"Hey. Hey. Don't be sad. Tell you what. When I get back up to Headquarters, I'll make sure Riley remembers you."
Bing Bong,You will?
Joy,Of course. She'd love that.
Bing Bong,This is the greatest day of my life!
Joy,Are you okay?
Sadness,"Hey, what's going on?"
Bing Bong,"I cry candy. Try the caramel, it's delicious."
Joy,Ooh.
Bing Bong,Here use this.
Joy,Thanks.
Bing Bong,"Oh, hold on. Wait a second. Here. What? It's imaginary."
Joy,Thanks. This will make it a lot easier to walk back to Headquarters.
Bing Bong,Walk? We're not walking. We're taking the Train of Thought.
Joy,"The Train! Of course. That is so much faster, but how do we catch it?"
Bing Bong,"Well, it kind of goes all over the place, but there is a station in Imagination Land. I know a shortcut. Come on, this way."
Joy,Oh. I'm so glad we ran into you.
Bing Bong,The station is right in here. After you.
Sadness,Joy.
Joy,What?
Sadness,"Well, I read about this place in the manual. We shouldn't go in there."
Joy,Bing Bong says it's the quickest way to Headquarters.
Sadness,"No, but, Joy, this is abstract thought."
Bing Bong,"What are you talking about? I go in here all the time. It's a shortcut. You see. D-A-N-G-E-R. Shortcut. I'll prove it to you. Look at me. I'm closer to the station, cause I'm taking the shortcut!"
Sadness,Let.let's go around. This way.
Bing Bong,Almost there.
Joy,"If you want to walk the long way, go for it. But Riley needs to be happy. I'm not missing that train. Bing Bong knows what he is doing. He's part dolphin, they're very smart."
Sadness,"Well, I guess."
Mind Worker #1,Okay. What abstract concept are we trying to comprehend today?
Mind Worker #2,"Um, loneliness."
Mind Worker #1,Hm. Looks like there's something in there. I'm gonna turn it on for a minute and burn out the gunk.
Bing Bong,"What did I tell ya, you'll be in Headquarters in no time. Hey, will you look at that?"
Joy,Woh. What's happening?
Sadness,"Oh, no. They turned it on."
Bing Bong,Never seen this before. My face! My beautiful face!
Joy,What is going on?
Sadness,We're abstracting! There are four stages. This is the first. Non-objective fragmentation!
Bing Bong,"Alright, do not panic. What is important is that we all stay together."
Joy,Oh!
Sadness,We're in the second stage. We're deconstructing!
Bing Bong,"I can't feel my legs! Oh, there they are."
Joy,"Come here, me!"
Sadness,We gotta get out of here! Before we're not even shape and color! We'll get stuck here forever!
Joy,"Bong, why did we come in here?"
Bing Bong,I told you! It's a shortcut!
Joy,The train!
Sadness,"Oh, no. We're two dimensional. That's stage three!"
Joy,We're getting nowhere!
Bing Bong,Death! Unlucky death!
Joy,We can't fit.
Sadness,"Oh, no! We're not figurative! This is the last stage!"
Bing Bong,We're not gonna make it!
Sadness,"Wait, we're two dimensional. Fall on your face."
Joy,Stop. Stop! No. I thought you said that was a shortcut.
Bing Bong,"I did. But, wow. We should not had gone in there. That was dangerous. They should really put up a sign."
Joy,How long till the next train?
Bing Bong,"Who knows? But don't worry, there's another station, that way. The Train always stops there, right before it goes to Headquarters. If we hurry, we can catch it."
Joy,"This isn't another one of your shortcuts, is it?"
Bing Bong,Yeah!
Joy,Is there really another station?
Sadness,Uh-huh. Through there.
Bing Bong,Welcome to Imagination Land.
Joy,Imagination Land?
Bing Bong,"Sure, I come here all the time. I'm practically the mayor. Hey, you guys hungry? There's French Fry Forest."
Joy,No way!
Bing Bong,"Check it out! Trophy Town. Medals, ribbons, everyone's a winner! I won first place!"
Joy,Me too!
Sadness,Oh. Participation award.
Joy,"Oh, no! Lava!"
Bing Bong,Imagination Land is the best.
Sadness,"Oh, has it all gotta be so interactive."
Bing Bong,"Hey, look! The House of Cards. Ooh, wait. Hang on just a minute."
Joy,Your rocket.
Bing Bong,"Yeah. I stashed it in there for safekeeping. And now I'm all set to take Riley to the moon! Oh, I'm sorry."
Mind Worker,Great.
Joy,"Oh, I love Imagination Land."
Bing Bong,Isn't it great? And there's always something new like. Who the heck is that?
Mind Worker,Imaginary boyfriend.
Imaginary Boyfriend,I would die for Riley.
Bing Bong,Wow. I've never seen him before.
Imaginary Boyfriend,I live in Canada.
Bing Bong,"Anyway, this way, through Preschool World. We're nearly to the train."
Joy,"Riley, here we come. Woo-hoo!"
Mom,"This should be fun. New team, new friends. There kids looked pretty good, considering they're from San Francisco."
Riley,Got to go.
Mom,"Okay. Good luck, sweetie!"
Disgust,"Luck isn't going to help us now. If she tries to use Hockey Island, it's going down."
Fear,Which is why I've recalled every hockey memory I can think of.
Disgust,One of these is gotta work in place of the core memory.
Anger,She's about to play!
Disgust,Hurry!
Fear,"We did it, gang. It's working!"
Disgust,It's like we don't learn anything.
Fear,"No, no, no. Breath. Find your happy place."
Mom,"Riley, what's wrong?"
Riley,Let's go!
Mom,You're not going to finish try outs?
Riley,What's the point?
Mom,"Hey, it'll be alright. Let's just."
Riley,Stop saying everything will be alright!
Joy,"Hockey! Oh, no, no. She loves hockey. She can't give up hockey. Bing Bong, we have to get to that station."
Bing Bong,"Sure thing. This way, just past Graham Cracker Castle. Hey, that's weird. Graham Cracker Castle used to be right here, I wonder why they moved it. I would have sworn Sparkle Pony Mountain was right here. Hey, what's going on?"
Joy,"Yeah, yeah. I don't know. We'll have to come back."
Bing Bong,"Princess Dreamworld! Oh, The Stuffed Animal Hall of Fame. My rocket? Wait! Riley and I were still using that rocket. It-it-it still has some song power left. Who's your friend who likes to play? No! No, no, no! You can't take my rocket to the Dump. Riley and I are going to the moon. Riley can't be done with me?"
Joy,"Hey, it's gonna be okay. We can fix this. We just need to get back to Headquarters. Which way to the train station?"
Bing Bong,I had a whole trip planned for us.
Joy,"Hey, who's ticklish, huh? Here comes the tickle monster. Hey. Bing Bong, look at this. Oh, here's a fun game. You point to the train station and we all go there. Won't that be fun? Come on, let's go to the train station."
Sadness,"I'm sorry they took your rocket. They took something that you loved. It's gone, forever."
Joy,"Sadness, don't make him feel worse."
Sadness,Sorry.
Bing Bong,It's all I had left of Riley.
Sadness,I bet you and Riley had great adventures.
Bing Bong,"Oh, they were wonderful. Once, we flew back in time. We had breakfast twice that day."
Joy,Sadness.
Sadness,It sounds amazing. I bet Riley liked it.
Bing Bong,"Oh, she did. We were best friends."
Sadness,"Yeah, it's sad."
Bing Bong,I'm okay now. Come on. The train station is this way.
Joy,How did you do that?
Sadness,"Well, I don't know. He was sad so I listened to what."
Bing Bong,Hey! There's the train.
Joy,"Oh, we made it. We're finally gonna get home! Oh, no. These facts and opinions look so similar."
Bing Bong,"Ah, don't worry about it. Happens all the time."
Disgust,"On a scale of one to ten, I give this day an F."
Anger,"Well, why don't we quit standing around and do something."
Disgust,"Like what, genius?"
Fear,"Like quitting. That's what I'm doing. Sure, it's the coward's way out. But this coward gonna survive."
Disgust,"Emotions can't quit, genius."
Anger,"Hey, our life was perfect. Until Mon and Dad decided to move to San Fran stink town!"
Fear,"But, I mean, it's just so drastic."
Anger,"Need I remind you of how great things were there. Our room. Our backyard. Our friends. Did I ask for the gum commercial?! Anyway, it was better. That's my point."
Disgust,"Yeah, Riley was happier in Minnesota."
Fear,Wait. Hold on. Shouldn't we just sleep on this or something?
Anger,"Fine, let's sleep on it. Because, hey, I'm sure jolly fun-filled times are just around the corner."
Joy,"Hey, hey. Why aren't we moving?"
Mind Worker,Riley's gone to sleep. We're all on break.
Sadness,You mean we're stuck here until morning?
Bing Bong,Yeah. The Train of Thought doesn't run while she's asleep.
Joy,"Oh, we can't wait that long."
Sadness,How about we wake her up?
Joy,"Sadness, that's ridiculous. How can we possibly.? How about we wake her up."
Sadness,"Great idea, Joy."
Joy,"Thanks, come on. Woh. This place is huge."
Sadness,It looks so much smaller than I expected.
Bing Bong,"Wow, I can fly. I loved that one."
Joy,Rainbow Unicorn. She's right there.
Sadness,My friend says you're famous. She wants your autograph.
Joy,"No, no. Sadness, don't bother Miss Unicorn, okay? Sorry she's from out of town. It's so embarrassing, right? I loved you in Fairy Dream Adventure Part 7. Okay, bye. I love you."
Bing Bong,"Huh! Wonder what that means? Oh, well. Let's go in."
Dream Director,"Set up the classroom set! Today's memories are in, we've got a lot to work with here. Riley dumped her best friend, had a miserable day at school and quit hockey. The writers had put together a killer script."
Fear,"Just because Joy and Sadness are gone, I have the stupid dream duty."
Joy,Okay. How are we gonna wake her up?
Sadness,"Well, she wakes up sometimes when she has a scary dream. We could scare her."
Joy,"Scare her? No, no. She's been through enough already."
Sadness,"But, Joy."
Joy,"Sadness, you may know your way around down here. But I know Riley. We're gonna make her so happy, she'll wake up with exhilaration. We'll excite her awake."
Sadness,That's never happened before.
Joy,"Wooh, Riley loves dogs. Put this on."
Sadness,I don't think that'll work.
Joy,Bing Bong.
Bing Bong,Yeah.
Joy,Don't let anything happen to these.
Bing Bong,Got it.
Dream Director,"Uh-huh. Add the reality distortion filter. Love it. Remember, play to the camera everyone. Riley is the camera. Makeup, get out of there. We are on in five, four, three."
Riley's Teacher,Hello class. Before we begin today's pop quiz.
Fear,"Man, she is one bad actress. Teeth falling out. Yeah, I'm used to that one. Let me guess, we have no pants on."
Student in Riley's Dream,"Hey, look. She came to school with no pants on!"
Fear,Called it!
Joy,Ready?
Sadness,I don't think this happy thing is going to work. But if we scare her.
Joy,"Just follow my lead. Here we go. Bark, bark, bark, bark."
Dream Director,Who is that?
Fear,"Uh, what's going on?"
Dream Director,They're trying to wake her up. Call security.
Bing Bong,"Hi, Riley. It's me."
Fear,Bing Bong?
Joy,"Sadness, you are ruining this dream. You're scaring her."
Sadness,"But look, it's working."
Dream Director,They're not part of this dream. Get them.
Dream Director,They're not part of this dream. Get them.
Subconscious Guard Frank,Stop right there!
Dream Director,Pan away. Pan away.
Fear,Boo! Pick a Pot line.
Bing Bong,You can't do this. I know people in Headquarters.
Joy,"No, no, no, no, no, no! There go the core memories."
Bing Bong,"Not in there. I'm scared of the dark, please!"
Joy,Come on. What is this place?
Sadness,The subconscious. It's where they take all the troublemakers.
Subconscious Guard Frank,My hat feels loose.
Joy,How do we get in?
Subconscious Guard Dave,Let me see.
Subconscious Guard Frank,Have you got my hat or is that your hat?
Subconscious Guard Dave,"Yeah, it's my hat."
Subconscious Guard Frank,You sure?
Subconscious Guard Dave,I don't know.
Subconscious Guard Frank,Look at the label.
Subconscious Guard Dave,"Yeah, it says my hat."
Subconscious Guard Frank,"Wait. It says ""my hat""?"
Subconscious Guard Dave,"""My hat"", it says."
Subconscious Guard Frank,That's what I wrote in my hat.
Subconscious Guard Dave,What are you talking about?
Subconscious Guard Frank,Look. You've got my hat on.
Subconscious Guard Dave,"Okay, it's my hat."
Subconscious Guard Frank,"Hey, you!"
Sadness,"Oh, you caught us."
Subconscious Guard Dave,Get back in there. No escaping.
Sadness,Oh. I don't like it here. It's where they keep Riley's darkest fears.
Joy,It's broccoli.
Sadness,The stairs to the biggest smite.
Joy,Grandma's vacuum cleaner! Bing Bong.
Bing Bong,Joy?
Joy,There you are.
Bing Bong,Shhh.
Joy,It's Jangles. Do you have the core memories?
Bing Bong,Yeah. All he cared about was the candy.
Bing Bong,We're outta here. Let's get to that train.
Joy,Wait. The train is not running. We still have to wake up Riley.
Sadness,But how?
Bing Bong,"Oh, no."
Joy,"Hey, Sadness. Did you hear about the party they were having?"
Sadness,"Yeah. Yes, Joy. Isn't it a b-b-birthday party?"
Jangles,Did you say birthday?
Joy,And there's going to be cake and presents.
Sadness,And games and balloons.
Jangles,A birthday!
Joy,"Okay. Follow us. Nothing like a good scare to wake you up, right?"
Subconscious Guard Dave,"Okay, it's my hand writing."
Subconscious Guard Frank,"No, it isn't. It's my hat, I wrote that."
Subconscious Guard Dave,"No, but this one's my hat."
Disgust,What is going on?
Anger,He did it again.
Fear,"We were at school, and we were naked and there was a dog. The back half was.was chasing it, and there was a Bing Bong!"
Anger,You idiot. It was a dream! This is ridiculous. We can't even get a good night sleep anymore. Time to take action. Stupid Mom and Dad. If they hadn't moved us none of this would have happened. Who's with me?
Fear,"Um, um, um, um. No, no, no, no."
Disgust,Yeah. Let's do it.
Anger,She took it. There's no turning back.
Disgust,So how are we going to get to Minnesota from here?
Anger,"Well, why don't we go down to the elephant lot and rent an elephant?"
